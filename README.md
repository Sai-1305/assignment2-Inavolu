## Table Tennis
__Table Tennis__ involves all the four players. Consider two teams: '__Team-A__' with players '__A1__' & '__A2__' and '__Team-B__' with players '__B1__' & '__B2__'. When __A1__ is the first to play the ball, the sequence to play the ball will be: **A1**-**B1**-**A2**-**B2**-**A1**. In such, each and every player has to play the ball. With this, every player does some physical activity of course, to __burn the calories__. Also, Table Tennis requires a lot of __patience__ and __strategy__.
