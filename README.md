## Table Tennis
__Table Tennis__ involves all the four players. Consider two teams: '__Team-A__' with players '__A1__' & '__A2__' and '__Team-B__' with players '__B1__' & '__B2__'. When __A1__ is the first to play the ball, the sequence to play the ball will be: **A1**-**B1**-**A2**-**B2**-**A1**. In such, each and every player has to play the ball. With this, every player does some physical activity of course, to __burn the calories__. Also, Table Tennis requires a lot of __patience__ and __strategy__.

## Cricket
This is another favorite sport of mine. Cricket is a sport which draws attention of a lot of people. The whole nation looks up to it. The national players will be under a lot of pressure. They require **strategy** and **patience** to handle the expectations of the nation-wide spectators. Similarly, even in the street-level matches, every person of the team will feel **responsible** for the team and tries to contribute with bat or ball or both. Nevertheless, cricketers require good **fitness** and have to be **consistent** with their play. At a personal level, I feel that cricket helps a person to be **fit**,**responsible**,**consistent** and **confident**.
