# Sai Chaitanya Vishnu Kanth Inavolu
I am a foodie. I go out and eat a lot of street food. I like cooking and at times, I cook my favorite dish at my place and have it along with my family. My brother loves the chicken curry that I cook. My mom and my wife like the egg fry that I cook. My friends like the mutton curry cooked by me.
